            They are
            trained in essential practices such as pre-operative assessment, aseptic precautions, and post-operative
            care, ensuring
            they understand the full spectrum of patient management. Special emphasis is given to minor surgical
            procedures and
            emergency care, preparing them to respond effectively in urgent situations.</p>

          <p class="styling-li">
            Alongside clinical exposure, students participate in ward rounds, case discussions, and skill-based training
            workshops
            where they learn suturing, dressing, and the use of surgical instruments.

          <p class="styling-li">The Medicine Department serves as the backbone of medical education, focusing on the
            prevention,
            diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. Students are trained through a combination of classroom teaching,
            bedside
            demonstrations, and clinical postings in hospital wards. They gain hands-on experience in history taking,
            physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic reports, which are essential for identifying and
            managing
            medical conditions. Regular ward rounds and patient case discussions help students correlate theoretical
            knowledge
            with real-life clinical practice.</p>

          <p class="styling-li">In addition to routine clinical training, the department emphasizes emergency medicine,
            chronic disease management, and evidence-based treatment approaches.</p>
